# projectA
Developing an application that can change the way medical prescriptions are provided.

The idea is to create an app that can be used by the doctors, pharmacists, the medical service center as a whole. To help a patient with the descriptions of their medicine doses.

As seen in most cases, a person could be injecting wrong medicine doses because the handwriting was confusing.
The project is focused for elderly patients who have difficulty reading. So a prescription that clearly mentions the doses can be a lot more useful.

The project to be easy to use. A quick plug in and play setup.
Server has Data of Doctor schedule, Pharmacy Inventory and Patients Contact Information (For the institute's use)

FURTHER:
