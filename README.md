Briefs:
Developing an application that can change the way medical prescriptions are provided.

The idea is to create an app that can be used by the doctors, pharmacists, the medical service center as a whole. To help a patient with the descriptions of their medicine doses.

As seen in most cases, a person could be injecting wrong medicine doses because the handwriting was confusing.
The project is focused for elderly patients who have difficulty reading. So a prescription that clearly mentions the doses can be a lot more useful.

The project to be easy to use. A quick plug in and play setup.
Server has Data of Doctor schedule, Pharmacy Inventory and Patients Contact Information (For the institute's use)

1. INTRODUCTION:
1.1 Motivation- 
Save Lives. Remove the misunderstanding caused by bad handwritings in a Medical Prescription.
1.2 Problem-
Mis-understood Doses. Misunderstood medicine drug composition especially for self sustaining old age population.
1.3 Solution-
Developing an app that can be used by the Medical Facility that can print/display on client app the appropriate doses. The correct prescription.

2. MOTIVATION:
2.1 History-
I witnessed, a death of a grandmother. She was an independent woman, travelled on her own. Stayed on her own, no she was not abandoned. That was the freedom she choose. She had pneumonia attack, two attacks were taken care of. In the second, severe one, she was in coma. However she recovered fit and fine. The prescription suggested change in medicine course after about a few months. The last checkup she did had was with a different doctor, so the different handwritting. It was miss read by the local pharmacists a few weeks later when she went to get her stock. The pharmacisits again put forth his theory. This led to a backfire. With in four days she had and attack. We lost her. 
2.2 Remarkable Issue-
A percentage of the oldage population i.e above 80 years of age do prefer to be on their own. Travel in religious groups to religious fares. Travel around meet family members across the nation. They choose to meet old friends talk of their days now-and-then. They dont like to be restrained by family, confined to a bed, within four walls. They want to life their old age to the fullest. 
Having said that, their body demands supports, atleast medically. 
It also needs to be noted. In South Asian region, there are geographical difficulties, accesibility issues, and litracy issues. Thus there is a need to have PRESCRIPTIONS that can be read and understood by one and all, clearly. 

Requirements:
I need volunteers to help me develop this app.

FURTHER:
Regional Language.
Handwriting recognition.
